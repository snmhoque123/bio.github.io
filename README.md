# S N M Azizul Hoque's Data Analyst Portfolio
## About Me
I am a dedicated Data Analyst with extensive experience in data analysis, data visualization, and data engineering. I am proficient in Microsoft SQL Server, SSMS, Power BI, Tableau, MATLAB, and Python. My expertise extends to ETL processes and statistical methods for data analysis. I am adept at utilizing cloud platforms such as Azure and Snowflake Cloud to deliver scalable BI solutions. I have a proven ability to collaborate effectively in fast-paced environments and drive data-driven decision-making.

With over five years of experience in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) analysis and its application to monitoring environmental data, I bring a unique perspective to data analytics. During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which are valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
